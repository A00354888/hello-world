Advanced English reading texts : while the majority of texts in this resource are at CEF levels C1,  a few are harder (level C2) and a few are easier (level B2). All the texts in this collection are written in normal English; however in order to maximize their language  teaching potential, most have been specifically written for students of English as a foreign or second language, or else for high school students. Texts are accompanied by worksheets designed to prepare students for the Cambridge Advanced English (C1) certification or other national and international advanced English exams. Most have also been written for international readers whose home culture is not British or American.
For this reason they avoid (or explain)  linguistic or cultural references that are unlikely to be understood by readers without the background of native speakers.
